I do not take any responsibility if you get into trouble
These files are all made with a custom text character that cannot be seen on any computer except mine,
so no computer can read the files, or even open the files
If you need any other type of file to be made/corrupted, just ask me
Don't worry about the files somehow opening, it is impossible for these files to ever open.
When you try to open the files, the app they are meant to open in will open, but the file itself will not be visible
